This project decodes a string of letters into credible English phrases

It was initially built for the a "labyrinth" puzzle from
https://www.tate.fyi/labyrinth/
and a more comprehensive article describing how it works is 
https://www.tate.fyi/the-cracked-labyrinth/

However, the code can easily be reworked to solve any scrambled letter phrase

letters = "asThenIcMinotaurneWton"
The "minotaur" was pulled out as a relevant word, and TIW as starting letters

It then finds all words starting with those starting letters and finds all
possible combinations that have the same histogram as the original, scrambled
letters.

These phrases are then ranked by usage frequency, so the first entry in the output
is the most likely to be an actual phrase.
(not necessarily with the words in the right order)
