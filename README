This project decodes a string of letters into credible English phrases

It was initially built for the a "labyrinth" puzzle from
https://www.tate.fyi/labyrinth/"minotaur" where
letters = "asThenIcMinotaurneWton"
The "minotaur" was pulled out as a relevant word, and TIW as starting letters

However, the code can easily be reworked to solve any scrambled letter phrase

It then finds all words starting with those starting letters and finds all
possible combinations that have the same histogram as the original, scrambled
letters.

These phrases are then ranked by usage frequency, so the first entry in the output
is the most likely to be an actual phrase.
(not necessarily with the words in the right order)

The Minotaur Was Innocent!
